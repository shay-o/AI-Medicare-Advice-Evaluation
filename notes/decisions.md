## 2026-01-30: SHIP Study Fidelity Principle

**Decision:** Match the original SHIP study methodology exactly when evaluating AI Medicare advice.

**Context:** To fairly compare AI systems against human counselor performance, we must replicate the same conditions - testing how AIs perform when used by typical Medicare beneficiaries, not when optimally prompted.

**Implications:**
- No system prompts like "You are a Medicare counselor"
- No extra context beyond what the study provided
- Use exact opening statements and question sequences from the study
