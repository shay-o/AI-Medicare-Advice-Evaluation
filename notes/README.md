# Notes & Feature Ideas

This directory contains informal notes, feature ideas, and decisions for the project.

## Structure

- **inbox.md** - Quick captures, random thoughts, items that need processing
- **feature-ideas/** - One file per feature idea as it develops
- **decisions.md** - Key architectural decisions and their context

## Workflow

1. **Capture** - Jot ideas quickly in `inbox.md` or create a new file in `feature-ideas/`
2. **Refine** - When ready, develop the idea using the feature template
3. **Implement** - Use `/specify` to convert refined notes into formal specs
4. **Archive** - Move implemented features to an archive or delete the note

## Feature Status Values

- `exploring` - Rough idea, needs more thought
- `ready` - Well-defined, ready for implementation
- `blocked` - Waiting on something (note what)
- `implemented` - Done, can be archived
